# TokeSocial Governence Proposal

This document is submitted for thoughtful consideration and discussion. All feedback will be taken into consideration for the process of formalizing these ideas into a proper proposal.

# Abstract

TokeSocial requires a governence plan which fosters a community effort and all contributors are treated equally.

# Core Goals

Given the minimal amount of start-up capital and uncertainty regarding the financial goals of the project, it would be prudent to avoid paying out of pocket for structure and licenses that we may not end up needing in the short term.

# Specification

TokeSocial is aiming to be a community-based organization which we can all contribute to and benefit from. Governence shall be a community effort. We also propose that TokeSocial voter tokes are created simply to represent voting rights.

## Tokens

It is submitted that we assign zero value to all holdings regarding the district, as to avoid any tokens we distribute becoming securities in the eyes of the law. Eight tokens will be created. One token shall be distributed to each land staker per land and represent their voting share in TokeSocial. Tokens may be minted via voted consensus to reward key staff brought into the project in the future.

### Why?

Filing with the SEC would be a requirement for profit-sharing, as would setting up a legal holding to manage profits. Those things cost money and the ROI is unknown.

## Voting

- Each token will carry a voting weight equal to 100% / (total active shares).
- Voting concensus is defined as 67% of all voting contributors, or greater than 50% of all voters total.
- Voting on a particular proposal shall last no longer than 7 days.
- One person's individual voting weight caps at 50% of the total vote to avoid a supermajority.

## When is voting required

*Everything* requires a proposal and vote in order to move forward. In order to keep the project from becoming stale, district leadership suggests that one of the first proposals "fix" this issue and assign some more reasonable limitations and expectations around what shall be required to vote upon.

## Future

Any and all profits and/or contributions or investments will be deposited directly into a common fund for the district arbitrated by leadership. If and when this fund reaches a value that would allow for a formal filing as an organized entity, a proposal and vote will be launched. This vote must resolve unanimously in favor of the decision to move forward. If the vote is greater than 51% in favor, those who vote nay must allow themselves to be bought out by any willing party in favor of filing. If the vote is less than 51% in favor, the motion will fail and a revote may be called by leadership no shorter than two months later.
