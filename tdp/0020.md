# Abstract
TokeSocial contributions should be represented via a "membership" token (TOKE) in order to provide incentive to labour contributors and expenses.

# Copyright/public domain
Open Publication License.

# Specification
TokeSocial shall use an ERC20 token to represent contributors share in the project. This will represent the weight of contributors' votes and any revenues that may develop in the future.

## ERC20 Token
ERC20 is an existing token standard easily adopted to provide a decentralized immutable ledger of contributors. [OpenZeppelin's Zeppelin-Solidity contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity) provide a proven reliable and secure base. Strong precautions, exhaustive review and unit testing should take place with any changes and new features to the Zeppelin contracts.

ERC20 tokens are decentralized and immutable, like Ethereum and Bitcoin. Although ERC20 carries a lot of desired properties for this application, some properties can also be seen as a negative effect. Ultimately, knowledge and understanding are mandatory.

### Initial Distribution
* Distribution is:
  * 30% to contributors
  * 30% to the startup fund
  * 20% to the district share
  * 20% to the founding leadership

#### Contributor fund
30% of the initially minted tokens shall be distributed proportionally to the LAND contributors based on the LAND contributed. These tokens serve as a record of share ownership of the TokeSocial project. These tokens give TDP votes more weight and may carries the value associated with.

#### Startup fund
30% of the minted tokens shall be used by the district to reward contributors for their efforts as well as onboard new members in exchange for their services during the district's startup.

* TokeSocial shall always strive to in-source work to existing contributors first
* Distribution of these token shall be determined by vote of the existing contributors.
* These tokens carry voting rights.
* The startup fund tokens shall only be used based on approval of proposals. 
* This fund shall be used for startup costs until the the district can cover it's own costs.

#### District share
20% of the minted tokens shall be held in reserve for the district and never to be spent. The district itself cannot vote, these tokens represent the revenue share the district keeps for ongoing costs. Maintenance, upgrades, land expansion, etc. Revenues shall be spent based on consensus vote of proposals.

#### Founding leadership fund
20% of the minted tokens shall be locked in the vesting contract and are released after 1 year. These tokens serve as incentive to organize and plan the TokeSocial district. Writing up proposals, refining ideas, recruiting and managing project contributors, filling in the gaps, and making TocialSocial and enjoyable experience for everyone. It is up to the district leaders to get the right people togethor and have TokeSocial built and maintained.

### Transferability
In order to effectively contact and build a team of dedicated project supporters, TokeSocial shall require any prospective contributor (receiver of "TOKE" tokens) to be approved by project leader(s) before they may receive membership tokens. This serves mainly as a filter to onboard valuable contributors.

### Loss of wallet private keys and theft 
In the event of loss of your wallet private keys, access to your membership tokens (TOKE) would be lost as well as any voting right or profit sharing. Make sure you backup your private keys safely and responsibly.

Theft of private keys is a large risk with ERC20 and crypto currencies in general. If you can, always use hardware wallets to store your membership tokens.

It is the contributors responsibility to research and understand Ethereum private key security and to take appropriate measures to secure their wallet private keys.

## Voting
This membership token carries weighted voting rights on TDPs. Votes are weighted by the amount of membership tokens carried by the voter.

### Mitigation against 51% attack
No single contributor may vote for more than 50% of a proposal unless there are no opposing voters. With no opposing voters this effectively enforces a minimum 2/3 supporting voters.

## Profit distribution
Profit generation shall not be the short term focus of TokeSocial and for all intensive purposes does not give membership tokens (TOKE) any value. 

We need to explore more what this would look like from a legal standpoint. In the case of any profit generation TokeSocial shall distribute (or reserve until the legal infrastructure is in place) them proportionally to membership token (TOKE) holders. One suggestion is to file an SEC Regulation Form D exemption. This restricts TokeSocial to less than 35 investors and requiring less than $1 million per year in investment. This may require registering TokeSocial as a corporation in Canada and possibly the United States. District Leadership will be responsible for setting up the corporation and shall be named as part of the board directors. Any associated costs shall be reimbursed via the start-up fund membership tokens.

# Motivation
The district is not going to build itself. There are 11 parcels of land to build on (including additional parcel from dafky2000, district leader), they need content, the project needs marketing and people need to be rewarded for the work involved. It is not the vision of TokeSocial to have many ride on the backs of a few who are willing to do the work and make TokeSocial a success.

It is also not the vision of the project to outsource everything and give all the membership tokens away. We shall strive to in-source all work required for TokeSocial's success, giving existing contributors the opportunity to earn a determined rate for their hard work. When required, the district leader shall find someone outside of the district to do the work.

# Rationale
The goals of TokeSocial shall remain in tact, it is a community based project to provide a safe place for cannabis users and supporters to gather and discuss issues and opportunities in the industry. TokeSocial requires services and resources to trade for those services to build this community and it is important that those "putting the time in" or incur additional expense are rewarded or reimbursed appropriately.

Contributors first, decentralization, and fairness are the primary motivators for the decisions in this document.

## Other considerations
There are a few other options that were considered and none of them can be done fairly, some reasoning is outlined below.

### Distribute land to contributors
This is extremely difficult, especially on such a small scale.
* Who gets the roadside parcels? Who gets the rear end parcels?
* Are contributors interested in selling the land, or building on it?
* Why organize a "district" at all?

### Distribute 100% membership tokens to contributors
This was also considered but it has been determined:
* The district leader has no incentive to progress the project.
* There is no incentive to build TokeSocial and build the proposal as outlined.
* The opportunity existed to purchase LAND to build on in the auction.

### Distribute some utility token
Decentraland has made it clear that MANA will be the in-game currency. This is also not an accurate representation of contribution or share of vested interest in TokeSocial as a community project.

We may consider utility tokens for use outside of Decentraland as an additional benefit to membership token (TOKE) holders in the future.

# Reference Implementation
* TODO: Build reference membership ERC20 token code
