# TLDR
"Too long didn't read" - A short digestible description of the entire document and the key points.

# Abstract
A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

# Copyright/public domain
Each TDP must either be explicitly labelled as placed in the public domain (see this TDP as an example) or licensed under the Open Publication License.

# Specification
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current TokeSocial features.

# Motivation
The motivation is critical for TDP that wants to implement within TokeSocial. It should clearly explain why the existing specification is inadequate to address the problem that the TDP solves. TDP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

# Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported elsewhere.

* The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

# Backwards Compatibility
All TDP that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The TDP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. TDP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

# Reference Implementation
The reference implementation must be completed before any TDP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the TDP is accepted. It is better to finish the specification and rationale first and reach consensus on it before writing code.

* The final implementation must include test code and documentation appropriate for the Decentraland protocol and TokeSocial policies.
